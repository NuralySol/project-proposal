## User Story

### MVP

I want to place an order with waived delivery fees,

## Stretch Goals

- **Pre-Order Scheduling:** Allow customers to schedule their orders well in advance, not just for immediate delivery. This could be useful for planning meals around specific events or times.

- **Enhanced Dietary Filters:** Provide more detailed filters for dietary preferences, allergies, and nutritional information, allowing customers to find meals that precisely meet their needs.

- **Detailed Nutritional Profiles:** Include comprehensive nutritional information for each menu item, such as calorie count, macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats), micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), and allergens. This could help customers make healthier choices and manage dietary needs.

- **Integrating an AI chat feature:** Personalized assistance, offer tailored menu recommendations and dietary guidance based on user preferences and health needs, provide nutritional advice and suggest healthier alternatives based on user data and preferences, etc.
